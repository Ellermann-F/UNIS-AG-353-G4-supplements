In March 2025 an UNIS expedition on Helmer Hanssen retrieved multible gravity cores and CTDs. One of them was the gravity core HH25-06-GC with a length of 516 cm, retrieved from a water depth of 152 m.
Subsequently, it was analysed by master students of the "Terrestrial and marine climate history of Svalbard" course AG-353 at UNIS in August 2025.
The laboratory workflow included:
1. cleaning and logging
2. 10 sub-samples from various depths
3. weighing of wet sub-samples, drying at 40°C and dry weighing
4. wet sieving for >1 mm, 63-100 μm and 100-1000 μm
5. grain analysis for the fraction >1 mm
6. foraminifera analysis for 63-100 μm: count of 100 benthic foraminfera per sample, species identification, amount of foraminifera per gramms of sample

The uploaded data represent the results of the analysis and serve as a basis for furter work.
