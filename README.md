In March 2025, a UNIS expedition to Helmer Hanssen retrieved multiple gravity cores and CTDs. One of these was the 516 cm-long HH25-06-GC gravity core, which was retrieved from a water depth of 152 m. It was subsequently analysed by master's students on the 'Terrestrial and Marine Climate History of Svalbard' course (AG-353) at UNIS in August 2025. The laboratory workflow included:

- cleaning and logging
- 10 sub-samples from various depths;
- Weighing of wet sub-samples; drying at 40°C; and dry weighing.
- The wet sieving was performed for fractions greater than 1 mm, 63–100 µm, and 100–1000 µm.
- Grain analysis for the fraction >1 mm.
- Foraminifera analysis for the 63–100 µm fraction: counting 100 benthic foraminifera per sample and identifying the species, as well as determining the amount of foraminifera per gram of sample.

The uploaded data represent the results of the analysis and serve as a basis for further work.
